5. Arrays and Strings
Q - 1. What are arrays in C++? Explain the difference between single dimensional and multi dimensional arrays.

Ans. The array can be defined as a group or collection of similar kinds of
elements or data items that are stored together in contiguous memory
spaces. All the memory locations are adjacent to each other, and the
number of elements in an array is the size of the array.

1. single-dimensional : A One-Dimensional Array is a group of elements
having the same data type which are stored in a linear arrangement
under a single variable name.

2. multi-dimensional arrays : In a multi-dimensional array, each
element in each dimension has the same, fixed size as the other
elements in that dimension. In a jagged array, which is an array of
arrays, each inner array can be of a different size. By only using the
space that's needed for a given array, no space is wasted.

Q - 2. Explain string handling in C++ with examples.

Ans. The string class in C++ provides a more powerful and user-friendly way
to handle strings. It offers various features such as dynamic sizing, inbuilt
methods for manipulation, and easy concatenation.

Q - 3. How are arrays initialized in C++? Provide examples of both 1D and 2D arrays.

Ans. Arrays in C++ can be initialized in several ways, depending on their
type and dimensions. Here's a breakdown of the initialization process for
1D arrays and 2D arrays:

1. One-Dimensional (1D) Arrays : 1D array is a linear collection of
elements of the same type.
ex. 1D array Declered by int arr1[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};

2. Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays : A 2D array is a matrix-like collection of
elements arranged in rows and columns.
ex. 2D array Declered bt int arr1[2][3] = { {1,2,3} , {4,5,6}};

Q - 4. Explain string operations and functions in C++.

Ans. In C++, a string is a sequence of characters stored in a char array. C++
has a set of string functions and operations.
---> String can be defined using the string keyword or C-style string .
ex.string str = "Text" or char str[] = {'T', 'e' , 'x' , 't' , '\0'};
⦁ String functions
---> Some common string functions in C++ include:
#include<string.h>
⦁ strlen(str1): Finds the length of a string
⦁ strcpy(str1,str2): Copies the content of one string to another
⦁ strcat(str1,str2): Appends two strings
⦁ strcmp(str1,str2): Compares two strings and returns a negative value
if str1 is less than str2, 0 if they are equal, and a positive value if str1
is greater than str2
