question 2
1. What are the different data types available in C++? Explain with examples.
=>1.primetive data type
=>2.non primetive data type
A.drived data type
B.user defined data type


->1.primetive data 
->A .integer (int)
->B.floating point (float)
   b.double data (double)
->C.character (char)
->D.boolan(bool)


->2.non primetive data type
=>1.derived data type
->A.Array
->B.function
->C.pointer

=>2.user define data type
->A.structhar
B.unioun

2. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion in C++.

=>implicit =Also known as type  coercion. this is when the complier automatically changes the data type of a value.
this happens when the program or language calls for a different type than the one given by the programmer.

=>explicit = also known as type casting,this is when the programmer intentionally changes the data type of a value.the programmer 
uses built-in function or operators to do this . 


3. What are the different types of operators in C++? Provide examples of  each.
->1.Arthmetic operator
->2.realtional operator
->3.logical operator
->4.assignment operator
->5.increment or decrement operator
->6.terronary operator


->1.Arthmetic operator
=>A. Addition (+)
=>B.subtraction (-)
=>C. multiplication (*)
=>D.Division (/)
=>E.Modulo (%)



->2.Realtional operator
=>A.  (==)
->B. (<)
->C. (>)
->D. (!=)
->E. (>=)
->F. (<=)

->3.logical operator
->A.(and operator)   &&
->B.(or operator) ||


->4.Assignment operator
=>A.  ( = ) 
->B.  (+=)    
->c. (*=)
->D. (/=)

->5.increment or decrement operator
=>A. (++a) pre increment   
=>B. (a++) post increment
=>C.(--a)   pre increment
=>D.(a--) post decrement


->6.ternary operator
<condition>?true:false;

4. Explain the purpose and use of constants and literals in C++.
=>constants and literals in c++ represent values that do not changes during program execution. they improve code readability,
maintainability, and help prevent accidental modification of values
->1.used to declare variable to not changed the value
Ex. const int a=10;

->2.literals = used to declare variable fixed values in the code
Ex.int a=10;
