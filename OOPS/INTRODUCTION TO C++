question 1
1. What are the key differences between Procedural Programming and ObjectOrientedProgramming (OOP)?
=1.procedural programming:procedural programming is a programming paradigm that involves breaking down a program
into a series of instructions ,or procedures,that are excuted in order.
 2.object oriented programming : is a computer programming styles that organizes software around objects,
rather than logic and functions . in oop,object are units that contain both data and code , and programs are designed by making them
out of objects that interarct with each other.

2. List and explain the main advantages of OOP over POP.
1.security
2.code maintains
3.code reusability
4.polymorephism
5.inheritance
6.debugging
7.data-management
8.problem solving

3. Explain the steps involved in setting up a C++ development environment.
1.install complier
->GCC
->msvc
2.install an ide or text editor
->dev-c++
->vs
->codeblocks
3.configure the environment variables
4.verify the setup
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
cout<<"Hello";
return 0;
}


4. What are the main input/output operations in C++? Provide examples.
->std::cout,
->std::cin 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int a;
cout<<"Enter your age = ";
cin>>a;
cout<<"your age = "<<a;
return 0;
}
